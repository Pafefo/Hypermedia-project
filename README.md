Target user: The main target of the CV are the interviewers from the different companies that you want to persuade in order to sign you in.

Information architecture: On the left side of the CV, I located general information about me (place where I live, my age...) and the different studies that I have done or am still doing. On the other side, I listed the jobs that I have done and some characteristics and abilities that I possess.

Visual Design: I tried to write a well-structured CV with the proper label in each section and with soft colors in order to relax the different readers.
